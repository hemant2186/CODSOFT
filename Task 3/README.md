## 📝 Task 3: Image Captioning

### 🗒️ Overview

Combined computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to build an AI that generates captions for images. Used state-of-the-art pre-trained image models to extract image features and advanced language models to create fluent, context-aware descriptions. This task deepened my hands-on experience with multi-modal AI systems and transfer learning. 🤖🖼️

### 📎 Files Included

- **image_captioning.ipynb**
*Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and demonstrations for the image captioning project.*


### 💡 What I Did

- Leveraged a pre-trained vision model (ViT) to extract meaningful features from input images.
- Processed these features using a transformer-based language model (such as GPT-2) to generate detailed natural language captions.
- Designed a robust inference pipeline to handle multiple image formats and batch predictions.
- Explored different sample images, confirming the generated captions were semantically accurate and descriptive.


#### 📸 Sample Image Captions

| Test Image | Generated Caption |
| :-- | :-- |
| A person with a mobile phone | A person holding a white and black smart phone |
| A man on a couch with a dog | A person sitting on a couch with a dog |
| Animals in the snow | A herd of animals are gathered together in the snow |
| Two cats playing | Two cats are playing with each other |
| Basketball action | A man jumping up into the air to catch a basketball |
| Dog with frisbee | A dog running with a frisbee in its mouth |

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
