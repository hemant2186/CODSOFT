# 🎯 Artificial Intelligence Internship at CODSOFT

## 🧠 Task 4: Recommendation System

### 📝 Overview

Developed a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. Applied content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies tailored to user interests. This challenge enhanced my grasp of information retrieval, feature engineering, and personalization in artificial intelligence. 🎬

### 📎 Files Included

- **Movie Recommendation system.ipynb**
*Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and usage demonstration for the recommendation system.*


### 💡 What I Did

- Collected and processed a movie dataset with key features (title, genre, cast, overview, etc.).
- Engineered a "combined features" column to capture essential movie characteristics for matching.
- Used **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to compute closeness between movies based on their features.
- Built a function to take a movie liked by the user and recommend the top 5 similar movies — presenting genre, summary, and ratings!
- Integrated **fuzzy matching** so users can get smart recommendations even with minor typos in titles.


#### 🍿 Sample Recommendation

| User Likes | Recommendations Include |
| :-- | :-- |
| Hera Pheri | OMG: Oh My God!, Baahubali 2, Special Chabbis, Uri: The Surgical Strike, Andhadhun |
| 3 Idiots | Taare Zameen Par, Chhichhore, Rang De Basanti, PK, Dil Chahta Hai |
| ... | ... |

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas \& Scikit-learn 🚀


### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Mastered the basics of content-based filtering for recommender systems.
- Understood and implemented text vectorization and similarity metrics.
- Enhanced code for usability, personalization, and robustness against user errors.
- Bridged AI concepts with direct applications in entertainment and decision support.
