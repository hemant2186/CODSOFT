## 👁️ Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition

### 📝 Overview

Developed an AI application that **detects and recognizes faces in images or video** streams. Leveraged both traditional and deep learning-based face detection algorithms, and explored face recognition using advanced neural network techniques. This project combined computer vision and machine learning to solve a real-world biometric challenge. 🤖📸

### 📎 Files Included

- **Face Recognition.ipynb**
*Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for real-time face detection and basic recognition demonstration.*


### 💡 What I Did

- Utilized **OpenCV** with Haar Cascades to accurately detect faces in live webcam feeds.
- Highlighted detected faces by drawing rectangles in a video stream for easy visualization.
- Designed the notebook to serve as a stepping stone for future implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning face recognition methods (such as ArcFace and Siamese Networks).
- Ensured the workflow is modular for further extension to handle image and video input.


#### 👀 Sample Functionality

| Input | Output |
| :-- | :-- |
| Video/audio feed | Green rectangles drawn around faces |
| Image upload | Faces detected and highlighted |
| Detection with multiple faces | All present faces are identified |

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- OpenCV (cv2) 👁️🗨️


### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Mastered foundational face detection methods for real-time applications.
- Understood pipeline construction for computer vision tasks in Python.
- Explored practical integration of AI models into webcam/video solutions.
- Set up a modular codebase ready for advanced face recognition algorithms.
